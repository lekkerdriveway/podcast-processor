        "transcript": "Welcome to Pop Culture Parenting! I'm Dr. Billy Garvey, and I'm joined by my friend Nick. Today, we're discussing how to talk to children about emotions, using the movie Inside Out as a backdrop. This Pixar film does an amazing job of anthropomorphizing different emotions and showing how they all play important roles in our lives. Nick, why don't you start by sharing your experience watching this with your kids?"

        "transcript": "Thanks, Billy. My kids were absolutely captivated by Inside Out. What stood out to me was how the film gave us a vocabulary to discuss emotions that might otherwise be difficult to articulate. When my 6-year-old was feeling sad last week, she actually referenced the blue character Sadness and could explain that sometimes it's okay to feel that way. It opened up a whole conversation about emotional health that would've been much harder without that shared reference point."

        "transcript": "That's exactly why films like this are so valuable as parenting tools. From a pediatrician's perspective, children's emotional intelligence is just as important as their cognitive development. The film shows that all emotions serve a purpose, even the ones we typically label as 'negative' like anger or fear. Let's break down some specific strategies parents can use to help children identify and process their emotions."

        "transcript": "First, naming emotions is crucial. The simple act of labeling feelings helps children develop emotional awareness. Second, validate those emotions - there are no 'bad' emotions, just different ways our bodies and minds respond to situations. Third, teach coping strategies tailored to different emotions. And fourth, model healthy emotional expression yourself as a parent."
