## SIBLING DECISIONS CHEAT SHEET

### Key Considerations When Deciding How Many Children to Have

**Benefits of Having Siblings:**
- Provides built-in opportunities for learning conflict resolution
- Creates a training ground for social skills in a safe environment
- Offers relationships that often last longer than any other in life
- Helps develop theory of mind (understanding others' perspectives) earlier
- Sisters especially tend to create positive sibling experiences
- Encourages development of pretend play skills
- Provides unconditional relationships that persist through challenges

**Benefits of Having an Only Child:**
- More focused parental resources (time, energy, attention)
- Often leads to better academic performance
- Tends to develop leadership skills earlier
- Often more mature due to increased adult interaction
- May develop stronger self-talk and self-regulation skills

**Practical Tips for Supporting Sibling Relationships:**
- Emphasize that the relationship between siblings trumps everything
- Prepare older children for new siblings through narrative and discussion
- Talk about the new baby's feelings to develop empathy in older siblings
- Reinforce caring behaviors between siblings, especially with older siblings
- Provide scaffolding during conflicts rather than solving problems for them
- Remind children that their relationship will outlast all others
- Create opportunities for bonding through shared experiences
- Avoid comparing siblings to each other

**For Only Children:**
- Create opportunities for social interaction through activities and sports
- Engage in pretend play to develop those skills
- Foster relationships with peers and extended family
- Provide opportunities to practice conflict resolution

**Remember:**
- No "magic number" of children is best for all families
- Parenting style has more impact than number of siblings
- Cultural context and family resources matter
- The quality of relationships matters more than quantity
