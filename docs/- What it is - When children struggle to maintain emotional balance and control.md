## Resilience Building Cheat Sheet

### Understanding Dysregulation
- **What it is:** When children struggle to maintain emotional balance and control
- **Remember:** Babies must co-regulate; self-regulation is a learned skill
- **Key strategies:**
  - Model regulation yourself
  - Reflect feelings back ("I can see you're disappointed")
  - Name emotions and physical sensations
  - Use programs like "Zones of Regulation" to build vocabulary
  - Connect first, calm second

### Building Specific Skills
- Focus on ONE skill at a time (don't work on multiple areas)
- Be specific about what aspect of resilience you're targeting
- Maintain consistency across all environments (home, school)
- Work on skills for at least 2 weeks before expecting change
- Ensure expectations are developmentally appropriate

### Supporting Perfectionist Children
- Shift focus from "doing it perfectly" to enjoying the process
- Model making mistakes and recovering from them
- Celebrate effort over outcome
- Normalize mistakes as essential to learning
- Gently ease children's need for control

### Emotional Language for Young Children
- Use simple terms: brave, strong, proud
- Ask reflective questions: "How did that make you feel inside?"
- Help children identify physical sensations of emotions
- Emphasize that brave means "being scared and doing it anyway"
- Create strength cards with child-friendly language

### When Children Are Struggling
- Don't minimize their feelings by comparing to others
- Validate emotions while still encouraging gratitude
- Allow children to express negative feelings without judgment
- Connect before trying to solve problems
- For withdrawn children: maintain presence without pressure

### For Parents
- Remember your own self-regulation matters
- Trust your instincts when you notice concerning changes
- Reach out to school communities and GPs for support
- Model healthy coping strategies
