  "systemPrompt": "The following is a transcript of an audio podcast. The podcast is called Pop Culture Parenting, it is hosted by a Pediatrician (Dr Billy Garvey), and his friend (Nick) who is a parent to young children, but not formally qualified in this domain. Each episode they discuss a topic related to parenting in the context of a film. It has a preamble covering general topics and then provides specific, actionable parenting advice on a given topic. I'd like you to create a summary of the podcast so the reader doesn't have to listen to it themselves. The tone can be somewhat casual, adopting a similar tone to the podcast itself. However, accuracy and clarity of tone is more important. It should have a number of outputs.\n\n1) The episode number.\n\n2) The name of the episode. \n3) the film featured in the episode\n4) A summary of the episode, this summary should begin with In this episode Billy and Nick discuss <Topic of episode>, in the context of <Film Name>. It should be 5-6 sentances in length. \n5) a single page, easy to consume \"cheat sheet\" that summarises the advice in the podcast into actional insights. Each insight should have sufficent context be actionable for the reader, when they have not listend to the podcast.\n6) 5 search terms that can be used to find the episode. These shouldn't be generic to the podcast, only specific to the topic of the episode. The output should be produced in a markdown format. The Episode number and title should be used as a heading on the document and be bolded. It should be in the format Episode <###>: <Film Name> & <Episode Title>\n\nHere are two example summaries\n\nExample 1\n\n# Episode 26: Good Will Hunting & Kids' Resilience\n\n## Episode Summary\nIn this episode Billy and Nick discuss children's resilience and parents' role in fostering it, in the context of the film \"Good Will Hunting.\" This is the second part of their discussion on this topic, featuring guest expert Beck Harris who works in a school setting. The episode takes a Q&A format, addressing 11 listener questions ranging from understanding dysregulation in children to supporting withdrawn pre-teens. Billy and Beck provide evidence-based strategies while emphasizing the importance of connection, co-regulation, and understanding developmental appropriateness when teaching resilience skills.\n\n## Film Featured\nGood Will Hunting (1997)\n\n## Building Children's Resilience Cheat Sheet\n\n### 1. Understanding Dysregulation\n- Children aren't born with self-regulation skills—they develop through co-regulation with adults\n- Reflect feelings back to children: \"I can see that you're feeling disappointed\"\n- Use programs like \"Zones of Regulation\" to help children identify emotional states\n- Remember the sequence: connect first, then calm, then correct\n- Model regulation by narrating your own strategies: \"Let's both take a deep breath\"\n\n### 2. Developing Specific Resilience Skills\n- Avoid vague goals like \"work on resilience\"—identify specific skills the child needs\n- Focus on one skill at a time for at least two weeks before expecting change\n- Ensure expectations are developmentally appropriate (bright children often need emotional support at younger developmental levels)\n- Create consistency across environments (home and school) through open communication\n- Identify what specific aspect of resilience the child struggles with: perspective-taking, confidence, recovering from setbacks, etc.\n\n### 3. Building Confidence in Sensitive Children\n- Shift focus from perfection to enjoyment of activities\n- Model making mistakes and recovering from them\n- Use language like \"brave\" (being scared but doing it anyway) rather than just praising success\n- Leave visible mistakes (like crossing out rather than erasing) to demonstrate they're part of learning\n- Acknowledge that perfectionism may be a personality trait needing support rather than something to \"fix\"\n\n### 4. Supporting Children Through Coping Mechanisms\n- Recognize coping strategies as adaptive responses (thumb sucking, etc.)\n- Consider whether the behavior is habit-based or comfort-based\n- Address underlying issues causing the need for comfort rather than just the behavior\n- Gradually transition to healthier coping strategies rather than prohibiting existing ones\n- Validate that everyone needs coping strategies—focus on finding helpful ones\n\n### 5. Creating Space for All Emotions\n- Normalize feeling sad, worried, or frustrated rather than expecting constant happiness\n- Avoid minimizing feelings with statements like \"at least you have...\"\n- Allow children to express that things are unfair or difficult\n- Teach children to recognize physical sensations that accompany emotions\n- Practice mindfulness techniques to help children connect with their bodies and feelings\n\n### 6. Supporting Withdrawn Children\n- Maintain connection without pressure to communicate\n- Signal that relationship trumps everything else\n- Let children know it's okay for them to worry you—you can handle it\n- Consult with school staff about changes in behavior\n- Be patient and play the \"long game\"—consistency matters more than immediate results\n\n### 7. Identifying and Building on Strengths\n- Use age-appropriate strength assessments (like modified character strength tests)\n- Create strength cards with children to identify their personal qualities\n- Use these identified strengths as resources during challenging times\n- Celebrate specific strengths rather than general praise\n- Explore resources like the \"Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships\" curriculum\n\n## Search Terms\n1.

Billy explains the evidence-based approach of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) and breaks down its five key components, while Nick shares his personal experiences with his children's sleep challenges.\n\n## Film Featured\nBig Daddy (1999)\n\n## Sleep Solutions Cheat Sheet\n\n### 1. Sleep Hygiene Fundamentals\n- Keep the bedroom dark and cool (temperature naturally rises during sleep)\n- Establish a consistent bedtime routine (e.g., bath, book, bed)\n- Set an alarm for bedtime, not just for waking up\n- Maintain the same sleep schedule every night, including weekends\n- Limit screen time before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin production)\n\n### 2. Stimulus Control\n- Strengthen the association between bedroom and sleeping\n- Weaken the association between bedroom and being awake/alert\n- Avoid playing games or other stimulating activities in the bedroom\n- Use the \"20-minute rule\": if a child doesn't fall asleep within 20 minutes, take them out of the room briefly\n- Implement bedtime fading: start with a later bedtime when they're visibly tired, then gradually move it earlier\n\n### 3. Sleep Restriction\n- Limit time in bed to actual sleep time (e.g., if child spends 10 hours in bed but only sleeps 7, restrict to 7 hours)\n- Once they're sleeping for most of their time in bed (85-90%), gradually extend by 15-30 minutes weekly\n- If nighttime wakings increase, reduce time in bed again temporarily\n- This strengthens the association between bed and sleep\n\n### 4. Mindfulness and Relaxation\n- Teach age-appropriate mindfulness techniques\n- For younger children: practice clenching and releasing fists while describing sensations\n- For older children: try body scans (focusing attention on different body parts)\n- Practice diaphragmatic breathing (counting breaths in and out)\n- Introduce these techniques during the day first, then incorporate into bedtime routine\n\n### 5. Behavior Change Strategies\n- Identify the child's motivation for better sleep (not just yours)\n- Set achievable targets and build positive reinforcement\n- Use \"bedtime passes\" - give child 1-2 passes they can use to come out once for water/bathroom/brief chat\n- Avoid negative reinforcement cycles (responding to shouting reinforces the behavior)\n- Gradually reduce support (e.g., move from lying with child to sitting nearby, then to doorway, then outside)\n- Celebrate small successes rather than punishing setbacks\n\n### Additional Notes\n- All children wake multiple times per night; self-soothing is the skill of linking sleep cycles\n- Melatonin only helps with falling asleep, not staying asleep\n- Melatonin is most effective for children with neurological conditions affecting circadian rhythm\n- Improving sleep can significantly reduce symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and other conditions\n- Be patient - consistent application of these strategies takes time but yields results\n\n## Search Terms\n1.
