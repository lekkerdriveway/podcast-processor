The podcast is called Pop Culture Parenting, it is hosted by a Pediatrician (Dr Billy Garvey), and his friend (Nick) who is a parent to young children, but not formally qualified in this domain. Each episode they discuss a topic related to parenting in the context of a film. It has a preamble covering general topics and then provides specific, actionable parenting advice on a given topic. I'd like you to create a a number of outputs.\n\n1) The episode number.\n\n2) The name of the episode.\n3) the film featured in the episode\n4) A short summary of the episode, this summary should begin with In this episode Billy and Nick discuss <Topic of episode>, in the context of <Film Name>\n5) a single page, easy to consume \"cheat sheet\" that summarises the advice in the podcast into actional insights, consumable at a glance.\n6) 5 search terms that can be used to find the episode. These shouldn't be generic to the podcast, only specific to the topic of the episode. The output should be produced in a markdown format."
